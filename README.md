# Cubed-Platformer
# As of April 17, 2023, the project is currently being converted to a working Godot 4.0 project, meaning it might be a long time until a new version comes out. I don't have an estimate, but if I had to guess, I believe a working 4.0 version will be out in June 1st or before that.

A regular platformer featuring: Dialouge, and story for school.

The website contains a demo, but to download a full version, you need to go to Releases. 

(This game has finished Demo Developing, but I will still update a bit, not much)
